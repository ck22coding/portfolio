## Overview

Problem Tracker is a tool designed to help identify the most valuable problems worth solving. By logging daily pain-points and rating them on two key dimensions—frequency and customer willingness-to-pay—you can systematically discover opportunities for innovation.

The primary purpose of this app is to:

- Track pain-points as you experience them
- Rate problems by how often they occur
- Assess customer willingness-to-pay for solutions
- Identify high-value problems worth solving
