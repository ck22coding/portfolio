# Plan — round 2

Written 2026-10-04. Branch `worktree-revamp`, worktree `.claude/worktrees/revamp`. Execute phases 1–5 in order; phase 6 is later.
Git in this worktree: use `/usr/bin/git` as single plain commands (the rtk hook breaks compound git commands).
Dev server: `npm --prefix <worktree> run dev -- --port 5173 --strictPort`.

## Status (2026-10-04)

Phases 1–5 are built on this branch. Phase 6 is not started.

Still needed from Carter:

- [ ] X profile URL → `profile.links.x` in `src/content.ts` (the icon is hidden until set).
- [ ] LinkedIn and X post URLs → `media` in `src/content.ts` (the Media nav item is hidden until there is one).
- [ ] Screenshots for project covers (still generated gradients).
- [ ] Whether to make `mode-memory` public on GitHub.
- [ ] Confirm the Eight Faces and venture fund pages are cleared with the client and Foundry before this branch goes live.

Decisions made while building (change if wrong):

- Activity squares show both sources behind a toggle. Refresh is a local script (`scripts/activity.py`); the scheduled GitHub Action was not added.
- Case pages built for: venture fund engagement (Topsail, client unnamed), Eight Faces, Companion, Balkanski, Locker. Shifts, AI LMS, and Knowledge Tree were not added.
- LinkedIn posts use the site's own card, not the LinkedIn iframe.

## Phase 1 — Nav icons

- Replace the "GitHub" and "LinkedIn" text pills with logos; add X.
- `PillNavItem.label` is a string and is rendered in two stacked spans (rest and hover state). Add an optional `icon: ReactNode` to the item type in `src/components/reactbits/PillNav.tsx`; render it in both spans; keep `ariaLabel` as the accessible name. Same in the mobile menu, where icon + text label both show.
- Icons from `react-icons` (already installed). Check which brand marks exist before use (`SiGithub` exists; LinkedIn and X may need `react-icons/fa6`).
- Test: nav links have accessible names "GitHub", "LinkedIn", "X" and correct hrefs; axe still clean.

## Phase 2 — Tools: name on hover, click through to the site

- Keep Logo Loop (it already pauses on hover and supports `href` per logo). Add `href` for each tool in `src/pages/Home.tsx` and move the tool list into `src/content.ts`.
- Use Logo Loop's `renderItem` to wrap each logo with a label that appears on hover and keyboard focus. No React Bits tooltip exists.
- Gotcha: the loop clips overflow, so the label has to sit inside the track (reserve vertical padding) rather than float above it.
- Alternative considered: React Bits **Dock** has hover labels built in, but it is a static row, not a loop. Carter asked for the loop, so the loop stays unless he prefers Dock.
- Test: each tool link has the tool name and the right href; label visible on focus.

## Phase 3 — Activity squares

Data sources:

| Source | Where the data is | How it stays fresh |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub contributions | GitHub GraphQL `contributionsCalendar` | Can refresh with no Mac involved: a scheduled GitHub Action runs the query daily and commits `src/activity.json`. Default token shows public contributions; private-repo counts need a personal token stored as an Actions secret (never in the repo). |
| Claude Code activity | `~/.claude/stats-cache.json` → `dailyActivity` (messages, sessions, tool calls per day, from 2026-03-23) | Only on this Mac. A local script writes it into `src/activity.json`; it refreshes when the script is run (by hand, or from one of the scheduled shifts) and pushed. The cache itself was last computed 2026-10-01, so check what updates it. |

- Render with `react-activity-calendar` (fetch docs via `ctx7 docs /grubersjoe/react-activity-calendar` first). One component, two datasets, accent-colour theme.
- If both: a small toggle (GitHub / Claude Code) over one grid, or two stacked grids. Decide from how it looks.
- Script: `scripts/activity.py`, same pattern as `scripts/loc.py`. Only day + count leave the Mac; no prompts, paths, or project names.
- Caption states what is counted and the as-of date, like the lines-of-code figure.
- Test: grid renders with an accessible label; the JSON has the expected shape; axe clean (check colour contrast of the lowest level).

## Phase 4 — Media section

- New `/media` route and nav item. Data in `src/content.ts` as a list of `{ kind: 'x' | 'linkedin', url, ... }`.
- **X posts:** `react-tweet` (`ctx7 docs /vercel/react-tweet` for the Vite setup and how it fetches). Renders like a real post, dark theme, no X script.
- **LinkedIn posts:** no public API for static rendering. Two options:
  - Official iframe embed — exact LinkedIn look; loads LinkedIn's scripts and cookies, light theme only, fixed height, slower.
  - Own `PostCard` (avatar, name, date, text, link out) — matches the site, fast, dark; the post text is copied into `content.ts` by hand.
  - Starting point: own `PostCard`, because it keeps the page consistent and fast; swap to the iframe if exact fidelity matters more.
- Layout: CSS columns (masonry-style). React Bits **SpotlightCard** as the wrapper for the hover glow, if it accepts arbitrary children — check the source first. React Bits Masonry is image-oriented, so probably not it.
- Test: each post links to its source URL; axe clean (third-party embed markup may need a scoped exclusion — record any).

## Phase 5 — More projects

Private repos cannot link to GitHub, so each needs somewhere to land: a short case page at `/projects/:slug` (problem, what was built, status, stack, screenshot). Gallery items then link to the case page or the repo.

Candidates, with what each would show and what is in the way:

| Project | Why it could earn a place | In the way |
|---|---|---|
| Shifts (day / night / morning / dream) | Most distinctive thing in the files: an overnight agent loop with review gates; 159 commits; already on the Skills page | Private; needs a diagram instead of a screenshot |
| Agentic education / AI LMS | Largest codebase (~43k lines); connects to the AI-in-education writing | Status not verified; read its PROJECT.md first |
| Knowledge Tree | Visual, and has a live URL (knowledge-tree-seven.vercel.app) | Dormant since April; check the live site still works |
| Balkanski | Ties the languages and mission story to something built | Personal-use app, private repo |
| Locker | ~23k lines, 240+ tests, real architecture | Dormant since 2026-08-18; must be labelled as such |
| Companion | Actively pushed; calendar and goal tracking | Purpose and state not verified |
| mode-memory | Already on the Skills page as the plugin | Repo is private; make public to link |
| Topsail engagement | Strongest result on the resume | Client work: anonymised case page only, no code |
| eightfaces (Perry), velocity (Foundry) | Real client / org work | Not Carter's alone to publish; needs permission |

- Each card carries an honest status label (live / in progress / dormant / thesis).
- Replace generated gradient covers with real screenshots where a UI exists.
- Test: every gallery item resolves to a repo or a case page; case pages pass axe.

## Phase 6 — Q&A agent (later)

Not built until Carter says go. Shape:

- **Backend:** one serverless function (`api/chat`) on Vercel next to the static site, streaming. API key in Vercel env vars only.
- **Knowledge:** a single curated `profile.md` (experience, projects, approved facts) loaded into the prompt with prompt caching. Small enough that retrieval is unnecessary. This is the "wiki about myself" item from PROJECT.md.
- **Rules:** answer only from the file; say so when it doesn't know; no private details (client names, contact info) unless listed as approved.
- **Cost and abuse:** per-IP rate limit, max output length, monthly spend cap, small fast model by default.
- **Before building:** load the `claude-api` skill for current model ids and SDK usage; decide AI SDK vs Anthropic SDK.
- **Tests:** a hand-written question set with expected facts and expected refusals. This is business-rule testing no conformance suite covers.

## Testing

- Already in place: Playwright + axe-core (WCAG 2 A/AA) on every route. New routes get added to the loop in `tests/site.spec.ts`.
- Add: Lighthouse CI (`@lhci/cli`, one dev dependency + config) for performance, SEO and best-practice budgets. Embeds and the activity grid are the likely regressions.
- Neither can check: whether the copy and numbers are true, whether synced data is fresh, or (phase 6) whether the agent's answers are correct. Those stay hand-written tests and manual review.

## Carried over (unresolved)

- Who the site is for (consulting recruiters, founders and clients, or both).
- Colliers, Ironclad, Optimal AI, Sandbox dates — which are right.
- Merging to `main` switches Vercel to the Vite build and stops GitHub Pages updates.
- `PROJECT.md` in the main checkout still describes the Quarto site.
